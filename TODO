Add Completed Priorities
=> If price is null, we're just checking if it's in stock
Send an email/SMS and calling (HIGH: Discord and text, MEDIUM: text, LOW: email)
Move to completed once the action is done
If there is a pricing error (example: Deal over 50%, send directly to high)
Message back something and it gets moved back from completed to in progress
